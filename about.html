                My obsession with design started in school. Unknowingly. Notes in workbooks had to be well structured. Colour
                coded.
                With impeccable handwriting. Basically ready for print. 100’000 copies at least! Had I known then that design was
                an
                actual career one could pursue - I would have been laughing!
              </p>
              <p class="about-paragraph">
                Instead, I was completely clueless how to spend half a century in business and followed the most given advice in
                Switzerland to someone like me: an admin apprenticeship at an office.

                My creative-outlet for the years to come turned out to be MsOffice - inspiring, I know. But word within my team
                began to
                spread quickly - no pun intended - and I soon became the go-to-wizard of spreadsheets, word docs and presentation
                slides.
              </p>
              <p class="about-paragraph">
                It only dawned on me after relocating to London that my wizardry could help people outside of my team as well! The
                seed
                of career-change was planted and I watered it every Sunday. For 9-months. At Shillington College for Graphic
                Design.
                MsOffice was just the beginning.

                What gets me out of bed today is my joy and drive to help young entrepreneurs kick-start their business ventures
                with a
                bang! The brand and web designs we create set solid foundations that look and feel professional, whilst always
                adding a
                fair bit of fun and lightness to reflect each unique vision, setting them apart from their competition.
